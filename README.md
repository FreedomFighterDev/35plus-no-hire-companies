# 35+ No Hire Companies
This repository aims to document companies in China refusing to hire employees aged 35 and above.

## Objective
- Raise awareness about age discrimination in the workplace.
- Provide a reference for job seekers to avoid such companies.

### Please Fill Out and Report Companies That Refuse to Hire Employees Over 35
In order to protect the basic human rights of Chinese workers and avoid age discrimination in the workplace, we call on Chinese workers to participate and list the companies that discriminate based on age and explicitly refuse to hire employees over 35. We aim to take effective action through the following steps:

List the Companies: Please list any companies you know of that explicitly state they do not hire employees over 35. Whether it's in public job postings or internal company recruitment policies, we want to know about these companies.

Share Discriminatory Hiring Information: If you have encountered age discrimination during your job search, particularly regarding discrimination against employees over 35, please share the information and experiences to help us record and expose these unfair hiring practices.

Encourage International Attention and Sanctions: We hope that the international community can impose sanctions on companies that enforce discriminatory hiring policies, especially multinational companies. Through international pressure, we aim to encourage these companies to change their unjust recruitment policies and ensure equal job opportunities for all workers, regardless of age.

Call on Companies to Change Their Policies: We also urge these companies to review and correct the age discrimination in their hiring practices, and to respect the value of all employees’ work, regardless of their age.

Why This Is Important
Protecting Worker Rights: Age discrimination severely affects many experienced workers, particularly those over 35, who are excluded from job opportunities simply because of their age. This unfair practice not only violates international human rights standards but also breaches the basic principles of fair employment.

Promoting Social Progress: By raising awareness and taking action, we can encourage more companies to reflect on discriminatory practices in their hiring processes and create a more fair and inclusive work environment.

We hope that everyone can participate in this initiative and help drive change. If you know of any companies that refuse to hire employees over 35 or have personally experienced such discrimination, please provide the company names. Let’s work together for a fairer workplace!

该资料库旨在记录中国拒绝招聘35岁及以上员工的企业。

##目标
-提高对职场年龄歧视的认识。
-为求职者提供避免此类公司的参考。

###请填写并报告拒绝雇用35岁以上员工的公司
为了保护中国工人的基本人权，避免职场年龄歧视，我们呼吁中国工人参与并列出基于年龄歧视并明确拒绝雇用35岁以上员工的公司。我们旨在通过以下步骤采取有效行动：

列出公司：请列出您知道的任何明确声明不雇用35岁以上员工的公司。无论是在公开的招聘信息中还是公司内部的招聘政策中，我们都想了解这些公司。

分享歧视性招聘信息：如果您在求职过程中遇到年龄歧视，特别是针对 35 岁以上员工的歧视，请分享信息和经验，帮助我们记录和揭露这些不公平的招聘行为。

鼓励国际社会关注和制裁：我们希望国际社会能够对执行歧视性招聘政策的公司实施制裁，特别是跨国公司。通过国际压力，我们旨在鼓励这些公司改变其不公正的招聘政策，确保所有工人，无论年龄大小，都有平等的就业机会。

呼吁公司改变政策：我们还敦促这些公司审查和纠正其招聘实践中的年龄歧视，并尊重所有员工工作的价值，无论他们的年龄如何。

为什么这很重要
保护工人权利：年龄歧视严重影响了许多有经验的工人，特别是 35 岁以上的工人，他们仅仅因为年龄而被排除在工作机会之外。这种不公平的做法不仅违反了国际人权标准，也违反了公平就业的基本原则。

促进社会进步：通过提高认识和采取行动，我们可以鼓励更多公司反思招聘过程中的歧视行为，创造更加公平和包容的工作环境。

我们希望每个人都能参与这一倡议，帮助推动变革。如果你知道任何拒绝雇用 35 岁以上员工的公司或亲身经历过此类歧视，请提供公司名称。让我们共同努力，创造更公平的工作场所！
