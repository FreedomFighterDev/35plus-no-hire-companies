# 35+ No Hire Companies
This repository aims to document companies in China refusing to hire employees aged 35 and above.

## Objective
- Raise awareness about age discrimination in the workplace.
- Provide a reference for job seekers to avoid such companies.

### Please Fill Out and Report Companies That Refuse to Hire Employees Over 35
In order to protect the basic human rights of Chinese workers and avoid age discrimination in the workplace, we call on Chinese workers to participate and list the companies that discriminate based on age and explicitly refuse to hire employees over 35. We aim to take effective action through the following steps:

List the Companies: Please list any companies you know of that explicitly state they do not hire employees over 35. Whether it's in public job postings or internal company recruitment policies, we want to know about these companies.

Share Discriminatory Hiring Information: If you have encountered age discrimination during your job search, particularly regarding discrimination against employees over 35, please share the information and experiences to help us record and expose these unfair hiring practices.

Encourage International Attention and Sanctions: We hope that the international community can impose sanctions on companies that enforce discriminatory hiring policies, especially multinational companies. Through international pressure, we aim to encourage these companies to change their unjust recruitment policies and ensure equal job opportunities for all workers, regardless of age.

Call on Companies to Change Their Policies: We also urge these companies to review and correct the age discrimination in their hiring practices, and to respect the value of all employees’ work, regardless of their age.

Why This Is Important
Protecting Worker Rights: Age discrimination severely affects many experienced workers, particularly those over 35, who are excluded from job opportunities simply because of their age. This unfair practice not only violates international human rights standards but also breaches the basic principles of fair employment.

Promoting Social Progress: By raising awareness and taking action, we can encourage more companies to reflect on discriminatory practices in their hiring processes and create a more fair and inclusive work environment.

We hope that everyone can participate in this initiative and help drive change. If you know of any companies that refuse to hire employees over 35 or have personally experienced such discrimination, please provide the company names. Let’s work together for a fairer workplace!
